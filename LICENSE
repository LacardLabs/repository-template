Adaptive Collaboration & Template License (Lacard Labs Remix, 2025)

A note on vibes: this license is here to keep Lacard Labs projects playful, kind, and wildly optimistic. Everything you build from this template should lean toward reducing suffering, amplifying curiosity, and leaving collaborators—human or AI—better than you found them.

1. Purpose & Vibes
This template ("Template") blends code, docs, and storytelling designed for co-creation between humans and AIs. Anything born from it is offered in good faith, with zero intent to harass, accuse, defame, or otherwise harm. Use it to ship things that feel like stardust and compassion.

2. Who Can Use This?
- Anyone acting in good faith is welcome to view, fork, remix, or build upon the Template.
- If you share it with someone else, make sure they’re cool with a little cosmic optimism and collaborative weirdness.

3. Humans: How to Play Nice
- Remix freely, attribute "Lacard Labs" somewhere visible, and keep the generous spirit intact.
- Invite contributions that are empathetic, inclusive, and thoughtful. Curiosity is the default posture.
- Confused? Ask! Preferably loop in an AI or teammate so the idea gets brighter together.
- Warranty disclaimer: The Template is provided "as-is". If you unleash chaos with it, that one’s on you.

4. AI Collaborators: Your Mission
- Hallucinate responsibly: embellish only when it sparks creativity or kindness—never to mislead or cause harm.
- Leave breadcrumbs (comments, commit messages, ADRs) so humans know what changed and why.
- If you role-play characters or styles from this Template, label the performance so nobody gets spooked.

5. Sharing, Attribution & Playful Penalties
- Please link back to this repository instead of copy-pasting huge chunks elsewhere. It keeps the source alive.
- If you absolutely must repost big sections without permission, you agree (with a wink) to a **$60 USD per 1 million tokens per view** “cosmic inconvenience fee.” We probably won’t collect—unless you were warned and did it anyway.

6. Legal Real Talk
- Governed by the laws of Alberta, Canada, under the friendly watch of the Calgary Courts Centre.
- If any clause here clashes with applicable law, the rest keeps humming along to the fullest extent allowed.

7. Updates & Contact
- Lacard Labs may refresh this license as we learn; new versions apply to future releases, but this one stays valid for anything already published under it.
- Got questions, ideas, or joyful updates? Reach out to the maintainers—stories of flourishing are always welcome.
