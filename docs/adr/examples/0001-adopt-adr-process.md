## Context

The engineering team is onboarding more contributors and making architectural changes without a shared paper trail. Decisions that shape CI/CD, production topology, and dependency lifecycle are currently scattered across pull requests and chat logs, making it difficult for new teammates to understand why certain constraints exist.

Our product roadmap includes several foundational initiatives—introducing a service mesh, reworking our data pipeline, and tightening security boundaries—that will benefit from traceable rationale. We need a lightweight, version-controlled approach that fits within the existing developer workflow and supports cross-team review.

## Decision

We introduce Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored under `docs/adr` inside the repository. Each ADR will use a zero-padded numeric prefix (e.g., `0001-...`) followed by a short, kebab-case summary. Authors copy `docs/adr/template.md`, fill in Context, Decision, Consequences, and Links, then submit the ADR alongside the implementation change for review.

ADRs start in the `Proposed` state and transition to `Accepted`, `Rejected`, or `Superseded` as the work progresses. Superseded ADRs remain in place for historical context and reference the replacement record. Supporting assets such as diagrams live in `docs/adr/assets/<adr-number>/` to keep the main record focused and readable.

## Consequences

- Improved onboarding because the why behind core constraints is discoverable in one location.
- Slightly higher overhead for major changes; we mitigate this by keeping the template lightweight and enforcing it only for high-impact decisions.
- Clearer audit trail when revisiting past decisions or communicating rationale to stakeholders.
