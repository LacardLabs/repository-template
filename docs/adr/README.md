# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture the narrative behind major technical choices so future contributors understand the why, not just the code diff. Use them when you:

- Introduce a new system boundary, integration, or deployment strategy.
- Replace a core dependency (database, queue, framework) or change a critical design constraint.
- Approve an experiment that alters reliability, scalability, or security characteristics.

## Suggested directory structure

The repository template keeps ADRs alongside supporting material so everything ships together:

```text
docs/
└── adr/
    ├── README.md               # Usage guide and index
    ├── template.md             # Copy for new ADRs
    ├── assets/                 # Placeholder README and numbered folders for diagrams (e.g., assets/0002/)
    ├── archive/                # Superseded ADRs moved here after linking replacements (README explains expectations)
    └── examples/               # Sample ADRs to reference; delete once the team has real records
        ├── 0001-adopt-adr-process.md
        └── 0002-adr-directory-structure.md
```

Keep live ADRs at the top level for quick discovery. Move superseded records into `archive/` once they link to the replacement decision, and store heavy assets under `assets/<adr-number>/` so Markdown files stay lean. The `archive/` and `assets/` directories include README placeholders that explain how to structure their contents. The `examples/` directory contains sample content you can delete once the team adds its first real ADR.

## How to create an ADR

1. Identify the next sequence number in this directory (`ls docs/adr`); format it as four digits (`0001-...`).
2. Copy the template: `cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/000X-short-title.md` and update the title to match the change.
3. Fill out **Context**, **Decision**, and **Consequences** in 2–4 tight paragraphs each. Reference linked issues, diagrams, or RFCs inline.
4. Set `Status` to `Proposed` while the change is under review. Update it to `Accepted`, `Rejected`, or `Superseded` once the PR lands.
5. Commit the ADR alongside the implementation code so reviewers can evaluate intent and execution together.

## Maintaining ADRs

- Add a short summary or index entry to this README if the list grows beyond what `ls` can convey.
- When a decision is replaced, leave the original ADR intact and add a "Superseded by" note pointing to the new record.
- Keep language plain and action-oriented; these documents should answer "what should we keep doing or avoid?" for future teammates.
- Link the ADR in your pull request under the Docs/Develop section so downstream readers can find it quickly.

## Example ADR

Use `docs/adr/examples/0001-adopt-adr-process.md` and `docs/adr/examples/0002-adr-directory-structure.md` as references if you are unsure how much detail to capture or how to handle links and consequences. Delete the samples once the team creates its first real ADR.
