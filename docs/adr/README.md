# Architecture Decision Records

1. Copy `template.md` and rename it with the next sequence number, e.g., `0001-use-postgres.md`.
2. Record the date, context, decision, and consequences succinctly.
3. Commit ADRs alongside the change they describe so the history stays in sync.

Keep ADRs lightweightâ€”capture the why and the tradeoffs, not every implementation detail.
